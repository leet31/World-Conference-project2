        <p style="font-size: x-large"><strong>Welcome to the 2017 World Congress in Software Engineer, Artificial intelligence, &amp; Computer Science!</strong></p>
        <p style="font-size: x-large">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong> An important mission of The Congress is "Providing a unique platform for a diverse community of constituents composed of scholars, researchers, developers, educators, and practitioners. The Congress makes concerted effort to reach out to participants affiliated with diverse entities (such as: universities, institutions, corporations, government agencies, and research centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also attempts to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as their main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions that have research as their main mission. The congress uses a quota system to achieve its institution and geography diversity objectives."</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>One main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into a coordinated research meeting held in a common place at a common time. This model facilitates communication among researchers in different fields of computer science, computer engineering, and applied computing. The Congress also encourages multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research initiatives; i.e., facilitating increased opportunities for cross-fertilization across sub-disciplines.</strong></p>
